A Database-Driven Web-based Information System
Summary: 
A web application that's allows you to see memories(photos and posts) of your friends at a particular location. Location can be inputed by the user or the user's current location can be extracted via Google Maps API. For example, a user goes to Chicago and uses the application to see photos and posts of friends who have to been to Chicago and all the places they visited and things they did while they were there. The application gives users information on things to do and places to visit based on what their friends did thereby providing personalized implicit recommendations.
